        <span style="font-weight: bold">It turns out that these two tables are made up of the exact same data, just grouped differently.</span> That is, 100 people’s salaries are represented in the left table and the same 100 people’s salaries are represented in the right table.

        There is no mistake in the tables, but it may seem like a <span style="font-weight: bold">paradox</span> when both are true:

        <ul>
          <li>
            The left table shows that people with master's degrees make <b>more</b> money than people with PhD degrees on average.​
          </li>
          <li>
            The right table shows that people with master's degrees make <b>less</b> money than people with PhD degrees on average, both inside industry and inside academia.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Which of the following could explain how both statements are true? <b>This is the main point of this experiment. Please take it seriously.</b></p>
