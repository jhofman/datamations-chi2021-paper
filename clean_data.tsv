static_ani	I think the animation would definitely help explain the stats.	static	impossible	none-of-the-above	I think I would need more information for any of the above information to be entirely correct. I think there are several factors as to why Masters would average higher than PhDs and some of the above might be partially (or entirely) correct given more information. Industry is going to be more competitive and have a higher resource base to pay their employees. PhDs are more likely to be involved in acadmia (e.g. my cousin is a biologist and professor.) Also, there probably are outliers within industry where some Masters are paid very high (as well as PhDs but there are likely more Masters.) So, I think it would be a confluence of some of the above reasons that would allow for this outcome.	{'outliers-drive-up-masters':0,'more-masters-in-industry':1,'left-more-than-right':2,'many-industry-on-right':3,'mystery-work-on-left':4,'left-not-stat-sig':5,'non-grads-on-right':6,'none-of-the-above':7}	7	static_ani	I think the animation would definitely help explain the stats.	2020-09-09 19:40:38	2020-09-09 19:48:42	simpsons_multiple_choice_tibble	tibble	FALSE	FALSE	1

Typically, within academia a masters degree will only enable an adjunct or associate professor position, while more stable tenured positions are reserved for those with phds.  This drives down the average salary of a masters holder in academia.  Within industry a masters degree will open up many more opportunities and higher paying jobs than in academia and there are generally fewer phd holders in industry with the small sample size driving up the average salary there.

Then, I came across two explanations above that could be possible. As I was shown the illustrations, I could not figure out why the charts were telling me two different things. I initially thought people with a master's degree made more than people with a PhD. However, when broken down by work setting, I saw this actually was not the case. I didn't understand, and I was hoping I was going to be told why. I am torn between the second and third options here: Most people with a master's degree work in industry or due to outlier, the master's point on the left chart can be higher than both the master's points on the right chart. It seems more people with a master's degree do work in industry, and the margin of error is very large on the left chart while nearly non-existent on the right chart., So, I can see how both of these options might explain the disparity. I am going with most people with a master's work in industry. There really aren't many outliers on either chart for people with master's degrees, except within academia. It seems the salaries hover around the same amounts.

static_ani	The main result of the study was that animation improved graphical perception at both syntactic (object tracking) and semantic (change estimation) levels of analysis. Even in highly predictable transitions, such as the stacked bars to grouped bars conditions, animation had a significantly lower error rate. As we masked each trial stimulus, the better performance in highly predictable cases may in part be due to improved transfer to memory. Survey results also revealed strong preferences for animation, as subjects found it more helpful and engaging. Furthermore, staged animation was significantly preferred to direct animation in most cases. This argues strongly for the efficacy of animation for depicting transitions between data graphics.	stepthru	impossible	outliers-drive-up-masters	Good.Today is new day.Because I will learn something new.It gives lot of information.In this study is very interested and very knowledgeable.Thank You so much...!!	{'left-more-than-right':0,'left-not-stat-sig':1,'many-industry-on-right':2,'mystery-work-on-left':3,'non-grads-on-right':4,'more-masters-in-industry':5,'outliers-drive-up-masters':6,'none-of-the-above':7}	6	static_ani	The main result of the study was that animation improved graphical perception at both syntactic (object tracking) and semantic (change estimation) levels of analysis.

Likewise, a PhD doesn't offer many benefits over a master's degree in industry so few people are likely to have this qualification, whereas proportionately many more people in academia are likely to have it since it is often a requirement for a tenured professorship at an institution.

Simplistic.	stepthru	impossible	many-industry-on-right	It is very possible to say that out of 100 people with a Masters Degree and 100 people with a PhD make a different amount of money.  It all depends on the industry jobs and what the salary provides them.  It is well known that most people with PhD's work tedious hours and there are fewer jobs for them to take.  People who have a Master's Degree tend to get higher salaries as they climb the ladder which is a lot quicker then someone with a PhD- Although having a PhD is more prestigious.  Most people with PhD's work at Colleges and Universities and study and teach more.  People with a Master's Degree tend to work more in the industry thus earning more.This was a fantastic study!

I appreciate the work put into the animation, but they slow things down.	stepthru	possible	none-of-the-above	I don't think any of these explain why there's this 'paradox'. I think the reason you see this discrepancy is because there were much more people with Masters degrees than Ph.D that were considered. Most of those 100 people that were analyzed had Masters degree, so if you average out the salaries by type of degree, you'll see that people with a Masters degree have a slightly higher average salary than Ph.D. Again, this is because there were a lot more Master degree participants than Ph.D. so it will drive up the number of the average salary. But then when you separate them out into work setting and degree type, you can see that Ph.Ds do earn more because you're not averaging out all of the degree types into one single group, but into separate categories based on the work setting, so that means that the whole lump of Master degree participants can't contribute to one whole lump average on just degree type. This then reveals that Ph.Ds earn more. I hope I explained it clearly enough.	{'more-masters-in-industry':0,'outliers-drive-up-masters':1,'mystery-work-on-left':2,'many-industry-on-right':3,'left-not-stat-sig':4,'left-more-than-right':5,'non-grads-on-right':6,'none-of-the-above':7}	7	just_static	The animations take too long and I have to wait for them to zoom so I can see the information.

just_static	None	static	impossible	mystery-work-on-left	I believe the table on the left is a vague table because it doesn't specify what occupation those workers are in. While on the right side it limits it to academia, and industry. This makes it difficult to gauge what those people are doing. I believe my choice was the correct choice because it takes into consideration people who in neither industry nor academia, and so they are unable to represent the general trend for those in academia, and industry. This makes it extremely difficult to say that those which career will provide the most salary. Due to the limited information on the left table it makes my choice seem like a solid choice because if you really want to get a sample size of specific occupation compared to another occupation you need to break it down by occupations, and not just by one side having a master or PHD while the other have a occupation. That just make it seem like the one on the left is average and comparable to those on the right. I believe this is not the case and I think expanding that table and using occupations would provide a more fruitful data quality and allow the researchers to see what the general trend actually is.	{'non-grads-on-right':0,'outliers-drive-up-masters':1,'left-not-stat-sig':2,'left-more-than-right':3,'mystery-work-on-left':4,'more-masters-in-industry':5,'many-industry-on-right':6,'none-of-the-above':7}	4	just_static	None	2020-09-14 11:59:42	2020-09-14 12:37:57	simpsons_multiple_choice_tibble	tibble	FALSE	FALSE	1242
